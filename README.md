### A Number Counting Game

[Demo](https://BKSpurgeon.github.io/numberCounter)

* Set the difficulty level and count your way to victory. Hopefully it will help kids learn their multiples.

### How to set up:

Written with create-elm-app. To set up, first [download this:](https://github.com/halfzebra/create-elm-app) and then run `elm-app start` in the root directory of the project. It should handle all the tricky stuff pertaining to webpack and hot rodding for you.

### Analyzer

* Note: There is a Google analyzser script added at the top of the `public/index.html`.

### API Key - GIPHY

* I have hard coded my personal API key. If cloning, please do replace with your own.
